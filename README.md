# Matplotlib Meet up on August 19th 2019

Matplotlib is essentially the original plotting package for scientific computing in Python. Most plotting libraries in Python are based on it, so if you can Master matplotlib, the other libraries will just become easier to ways to costomize your plots. Matplotlib is the most customizable plotting library in Python but it can be tricky to learn. Thats why we are hosting this introduction to Matplotlib meetup. We will be learning how to creat graphs from numpy and pandas data and customizing the labels and colors etc...

We will running this meetup from **4:00 pm to 8:00 pm** in the Colab in ERC 330 (across from the entrance to the Eastern Resource Center library) Note that access is limited by construction. See these links to help guide you: https://goo.gl/maps/XEoRevKESdr GIFs to get around construction : https://tinyurl.com/tram2colab, https://tinyurl.com/coffee2colab

This workshop will be using Python 3.6 inside the Jupyter Notebook. You can find installation instructions inside the 
[Python_Installation.md](https://github.com/resbaz/Sept2017_PandasWorkshop/blob/master/Python_installation.md)
instruction file. 

While we will be learning in the Jupyter environment, you may find this a bit heavy for your day-to-day coding life. 
There are a number of light-weight text editors and Integrative Development Environments (IDEs - this means you can write and 
run your code in the same program) freely available on the internet.

IDEs:
- Spyder. This comes installed with the Anaconda package, and you should be able to find it in your system's programs list after installation
- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). This one has a free community-edition license, but anybody working on research which could be patented, beware! The pycharm owners dislike the free version being used on for-profit projects, and the licensing reflects this.

Text Editors:
- [Atom](https://atom.io/). Free. No ads. Allows Git/Github integration.
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). Unlimited free license. Occasional pop-up ads. Slightly easier to use.
